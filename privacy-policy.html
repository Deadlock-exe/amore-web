        <h2>3. AI-Generated Content and Moderation</h2>
        <p>MiAmoré utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to generate content based on user input. While we strive to maintain ethical and policy-compliant content, AI-generated responses may not always be accurate, appropriate, or free from bias.</p>
        <h3>a. Content Moderation</h3>
        <p>To ensure compliance with Play Store policies, we implement the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sentiment analysis to block harmful or policy-violating prompts</li>
            <li>Logging and reviewing flagged AI responses for continuous moderation</li>
            <li>User reporting feature to flag inappropriate AI outputs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>b. User Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Users are responsible for how they interact with the AI and should avoid attempting to generate or share harmful, offensive, or illegal content. We reserve the right to suspend accounts that violate our content guidelines.</p>

        <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <h3>a. With Your Consent</h3>
        <p>We will share your information if you explicitly agree to it.</p>
        <h3>b. With Service Providers</h3>
        <p>We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who help us operate, maintain, or improve the App.</p>
        <h3>c. Legal Obligations</h3>
        <p>We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid legal requests (e.g., court orders or subpoenas).</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>6. Reporting and Flagging AI Responses</h2>
        <p>Users can report any AI-generated content they find inappropriate by using the in-app reporting feature. Flagged content will be reviewed, and necessary actions will be taken, including model updates or restrictions on certain prompts.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
